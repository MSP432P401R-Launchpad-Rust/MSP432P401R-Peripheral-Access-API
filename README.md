**MSP432P401R**

Peripheral access API for MSP432P401R Microcontroller generated with svd2rust version 0.17.0

You can generate this API yourself using generate.sh, but it requires you install a few things first.
If you have already installed cargo, it's as simple as `cargo install svd2rust` and `cargo install form`.
Once that is finished, the script should work.


See https://docs.rs/svd2rust/0.17.0/svd2rust/ for details on how this script works.

**SVD File**

This API was auto-generated from an SVD file provided by Texas Instruments. The SVD file is available from:
